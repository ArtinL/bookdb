# Artin's Media Finder

Welcome to my media finder app!

Originally, this project started as a simple web app that would allow you to search the name of books and display results using Google's book API. Over time, I added more features and overhauled the entire system to add more features, such as the ability to create accounts, save your favorite entries to a personal library, and even search for movies as well as books.

The project is still definitely a work in progress. Most of my development time has been spent on tech debt, specifically changing the entire program's structure to make media entries generic, as well as adding a backend and database connection for the library. Eventually, my plans are to add support for other types of media, like music and video games for example, as well as the ability to redirect the user to relevant websites to view and/or purchase the selected entries.

For now, however, I hope you enjoy the website! If you encounter any problems or bugs, pleased feel free to create an issue and let me know about it.
